# README for Novel States Simulations based on two components Rydberg atoms array

This is the repository for the codes of Novel States Simulations based on two components Rydberg atoms array quantum computer, including two parts, the ground state part and the Dynamics part.

Why do we need the quantum simulation? Do the traditional numerical methods have their drawback? Take the three traditional numerical methods:ED,TN,MC as example. The accurate diagonalization method cannot be used for large size calculation, the mean field method cannot be used for systems with quantum correlation, there is a negative sign problem in the montocaro method, and the tensor network state method can only be applied to many-body systems with low entanglement.

Why do we rely on the two components Rydberg atoms array quantum computer? The Rydberg atoms quantum computer has the character as Scalable number of atoms, Many-body spin interaction in target bit regulated by control bit, Controllability of arbitrary lattice structure, Regulation ability of interaction and coexistence, Additional degrees of freedom, Coherent manipulation and measurement means that can be addressed to the accuracy of a single atom, Measuring ability accurate to a single bit, Internal and external state available. In contrast to traditional Rydberg atoms array, it has the advantages as: Multiple types of interaction, Ultra high coherence, 

Thus in this new kind of Rydberg atoms quantum computer, we want to probe the novel states which haven't been found in traditional states. And based on experimental basis, to investigate their character such as Dynamic Phase Transition of Many-body Localization (MBL) and Eigenstates Thermalization Hypothesis(ETH) and Quantum quenching dynamics.


## ground state part
### possible novel states


### robust analysis

### DMRG to scan the phase diagram

## Dynamics part

### the path to implement it from given initial state

### many-body character such as QMBS
